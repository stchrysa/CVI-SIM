Survival Virtual Network Embedding Algorithms Simulator
--------------

Internet with its current structure imposes limitations on the development of innovative technologies. Network virtualization decouples the roles of Internet Service Provider and Infrastructure Provider allowing the coexistence of several heterogeneous network topologies. One of the most important challenges of network virtualizatio n, though, is the optimal resources allocation for the embedding of the virtual network, a problem known as Virtual Network Embedding (VNE). Furthermore, in order for Network Virtualization to be applicable, Virtual Networks must be able to survive link an d node failures, problem known as Survival Virtual Network Embedding (SVNE).

In this context, this project extends existing solutions for both VNE and SVNE to propose and compare algorithms that provide survivability over either single or multiple failures to a set of critical nodes and adjacent links to these nodes.
